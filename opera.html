    <h2>UTOPIA ACT II</h2> 
    <h3>UTOPIA LIMITED </h3> 
    <br> 
        ACT II SCENE-the same scene as in Act I with the exception that in place
        of the ruins that filled the foreground of the stage, the
        interior of a magnificent temple is seen showing the background
        of the scene of Act I, through the columns of the portico at the
        back. High throne. L.U.E. Low seats below it. All the substitute
        gods and goddesses are discovered
        grouped in picturesque attitudes about the stage, eating and
        drinking, and smoking and singing the followiang verses.
    </h3> 
    <p>
         
        
       <p> CHORUS </p> 
        
        <p class="CHORUS" >SONG — Fitzbattleaxe </p>

            A tenor, all singers above
                 <p class="direction"> (This doesn't admit of a question),</p>
                      <p class="song">Should keep himself quiet,
                      Attend to his diet
                 And carefully nurse his digestion;
            But when he is madly in love
                 It's certain to tell on his singing— 
                      You can't do the proper chromatics
                      With proper emphatics
                 When anguish your bosom is wringing!
            When distracted with worries in plenty,
            And his pulse is a hundred and twenty,
            And his fluttering bosom the slave of mistrust is,
            A tenor can't do himself justice,
                You see, I can't do myself justice!
            I could sing if my fervour were mock,
                 It's easy enough if you're acting—
                      But when one's emotion
                      Is born of devotion
                 You mustn't be over-exacting. 
            One ought to be firm as a rock
                 To venture a shake in vibrato,
                      When fervour's expected
                      Keep cool and collected
                 Or never attempt agitato.
            But, of course, when his tongue is of leather,
            And his lips appear pasted together,
            And his sensitive palate as dry as a crust is,
            A tenor can't do himself justice.
                It's no use—I can't do myself justice!</P>

  <h6 class="Zara"> Zara:</h6>     <p class="speech">Why, Arthur, what does it matter?  When the higher
    qualities of the heart are all that can be desired, the higher
    notes of the voice are matters of comparative insignificance. Who
    thinks slightingly of the cocoanut because it is husky? Be-sides
    <p class="direction">(demurely),</p> you are not singing for an engagement</p>

  <h6 class="Fitz"> Fitz:</h6>    <p class="speech">How good and wise you are!  How unerringly your
    practiced brain winnows the wheat from the chaff—the
    material from the merely incidental!</p>

  <h6 class="Zara"> Zara:</h6>     <p class="speech">My Girton training, Arthur.  At Girton all is wheat, and
    idle chaff is never heard within its walls!  But tell me, is not
    all working marvelously well?  Have not our Flowers of Progress
    more than justified their name?</p>

  <h6 class="Fitz"> Fitz:</h6>    <p class="speech">We have indeed done our best.  Captain Corcoran and I
    have, in concert, thoroughly remodeled the sister-
    services—and upon so sound a basis that the South Pacific
    trembles at the name of Utopia!</p>

  <h6 class="Zara"> Zara:</h6>     <p class="speech">How clever of you!</p>

  <h6 class="Fitz"> Fitz:</h6>    <p class="speech">Clever?  Not a bit.  It's easy as possible when the
    Admiral-ty and Horse Guards are not there to interfere.  And so
    with the others.  Freed from the trammels imposed upon them by
    idle Acts of Parliament, all have given their natural tal-ents
    full play and introduced reforms which, even in Eng-land, were
    never dreamt of!</p>

  <h6 class="Zara"> Zara:</h6>     <p class="speech">But perhaps the most beneficent changes of all has been
    ef-fected by Mr. Goldbury, who, discarding the exploded theory
    that some strange magic lies hidden in the number Seven, has
    applied the Limited Liability principle to individuals, and every
    man, woman, and child is now a Company Limited with liability
    restricted to the amount of his declared Capital! There is not a
    christened baby in Utopia who has not already issued his little
    Prospectus!</p>

  <h6 class="Fitz"> Fitz:</h6>    <p class="speech">Marvelous is the power of a Civilization which can
    trans-mute, by a word, a Limited Income into an Income Limited.</p>

  <h6 class="Zara"> Zara:</h6>     <p class="speech">Reform has not stopped here—it has been applied
    even to the costume of our people.  Discarding their own barbaric
    dress, the natives of our land have unanimously adopted the taste-
    ful fashions of England in all their rich entirety. Scaphio and
    Phantis have undertaken a contract to supply the whole of Utopia
    with clothing designed upon the most approved English
    models—and the first Drawing-Room under the new state of
    things is to be held here this evening.</p>

  <h6 class="Fitz"> Fitz:</h6>   <p class="speech">But Drawing-Rooms are always held in the afternoon.</p>

  <h6 class="Zara"> Zara:</h6>     <p class="speech">Ah, we've improved upon that.  We all look so much
    better by candlelight!  And when I tell you, dearest, that my
    Court train has just arrived, you will understand that I am long-
    ing to go and try it on.</p> 

    <h6 class="King"> King:</h6>    <p class="speech">Our city we have beautified—we've done it willy-
        nilly— And all that isn't Belgrave Square is Strand and 
        Piccadilly.</p> 

  
 <p class="direction">(Exit Zara. Enter King dressed as Field-Marshal.)</p> 

  <h6 class="Fitz"> Fitz:</h6>     <P class="speech">To a Monarch who has been accustomed to the uncontrolled
    use of his limbs, the costume of a British Field-Marshal is,
    perhaps, at first, a little cramping.  Are you sure that this is
    all right?  It's not a practical joke, is it?  No one has a keener
    sense of humor than I have, but the First Statutory Cabinet
    Council of Utopia Limited must be conduct-ed with dignity and
    impressiveness.  Now, where are the other five who signed the
    Articles of Association?</P>

  <h6 class="Fitz"> Fitz:</h6>     <p class="speech">Sir, they are here.</p>
  <p>Chorus:</p><p class="CHORUS">    this happy country has been Anglicized 
    completely Is really is surprising What a thorough Anglicizing We
    have brought about—Utopia's quite another land; In her
    enterprising movements, She is England—with improvements,  
    Which we dutifully offer to our mother-land!</p>
