    <h2>UTOPIA ACT II</h2>
    <h3>UTOPIA LIMITED</h3>
    <p>
        ACT II<br>
        SCENE-the same scene as in Act I with the exception that in place<br>
        of the ruins that filled the foreground of the stage, the<br>
        interior of a magnificent temple is seen showing the background<br>
        of the scene of Act I, through the columns of the portico at the<br>
        back. High throne. L.U.E. Low seats below it. All the substitute<br>
        gods and goddesses [that is to say, Thespians] are discovered<br>
        grouped in picturesque attitudes about the stage, eating and<br>
        drinking, and smoking and singing the following verses.<br>   
        <br>
        OPENING CHORUS.
        <br>
        In lazy languor—motionless,
        We lie and dream of nothingness;
        For visions come
        From Poppydom
        Direct at our command:
        Or, delicate alternative,
        In open idleness we live,
        With lyre and lute
        And silver flute,
        The life of Lazyland.
    
        SOLO - Phylla.
    
        The song of birds
        In ivied towers;
        The rippling play
        Of waterway;
        The lowing herds;
        The breath of flowers;
        The languid loves
        Of turtle doves—
        These simple joys are all at hand
        Upon thy shores, O Lazyland!
    
        (Enter Calynx)
    
        Calynx: Good news! Great news! His Majesty's eldest daughter,
        Princess Zara, who left our shores five years since to go to
        England—the greatest, the most powerful, the wisest country
        in the world—has taken a high degree at Girton, and is on
        her way home again, having achieved a complete mastery over all
        the elements that have tended to raise that glorious country to
        her present preeminent position among civilized nations!
    
        Salata: Then in a few months Utopia may hope to be completely
        Anglicized?
    
        Calynx: Absolutely and without a doubt.
    
        Melene: (lazily) We are very well as we are. Life without a
        care—every want supplied by a kind and fatherly monarch,
        who, despot though he be, has no other thought than to make his
        people happy—what have we to gain by the great change that
        is in store for us?
    
        Salata: What have we to gain? English institutions, English
        tastes, and oh, English fashions!
    
        Calynx: England has made herself what she is because, in that
        favored land, every one has to think for himself. Here we have
        no need to think, because our monarch anticipates all our wants,
        and our political opinions are formed for us by the journals to
        which we subscribe. Oh, think how much more brilliant this
        dialogue would have been, if we had been accustomed to exercise
        our reflective powers! They say that in England the conversation
        of the very meanest is a coruscation of impromptu epigram!
    
        (Enter Tarara in a great rage)
    
        Tarara: Lalabalele talala! Callabale lalabalica falahle!
    
        Calynx: (horrified) Stop—stop, I beg! (All the ladies
        close their ears.)
    
        Tarara: Callamalala galalate! Caritalla lalabalee kallalale
        poo!
    
        Ladies: Oh, stop him! stop him!
    
        Calynx: My lord, I'm surprised at you. Are you not aware that
        His Majesty, in his despotic acquiescence with the emphatic wish
        of his people, has ordered that the Utopian language shall be
        banished from his court, and that all communications shall
        henceforward be made in the English tongue?
    
        Tarara: Yes, I'm perfectly aware of it, although—(suddenly
        presenting an explosive "cracker"). Stop—allow me.
    
        Calynx: (pulls it). Now, what's that for?
    
        Tarara: Why, I've recently been appointed Public Exploder to His
        Majesty, and as I'm constitutionally nervous, I must accustom
        myself by degrees to the startling nature of my duties. Thank you.
        I was about to say that although, as Public Exploder, I am next in
        succession to the throne, I nevertheless do my best to fall in
        with the royal decree. But when I am overmastered by an indignant
        sense of overwhelming wrong, as I am now, I slip into my native
        tongue without knowing it. I am told that in the language of that
        great and pure nation, strong expressions do not exist, consequently
        when I want to let off steam I have no alternative but to
        say, "Lalabalele molola lililah kallalale poo!"
    
        Calynx: But what is your grievance?
    
        Tarara: This—by our Constitution we are governed by a
        Despot who, although in theory absolute—is, in practice,
        nothing of the kind—being watched day and night by two Wise
        Men whose duty it is, on his very first lapse from political or
        social propriety, to denounce him to me, the Public Exploder, and
        it then becomes my duty to blow up His Majesty with
        dynamite—allow me. (Presenting a cracker which Calynx
        pulls.) Thank you—and, as some compensation to my wounded
        feelings, I reign in his stead.
    
        Calynx: Yes. After many unhappy experiments in the direction of
        an ideal Republic, it was found that what may be described as a
        Despotism tempered by Dynamite provides, on the whole, the most
        satisfactory description of ruler—an autocrat who dares not
        abuse his autocratic power.
    
        Tarara: That's the theory—but in practice, how does it
        act? Now, do you ever happen to see the Palace Peeper? (producing
        a "Society" paper).
    
        Calynx: Never even heard of the journal.
    
        Tarara: I'm not surprised, because His Majesty's agents always
        buy up the whole edition; but I have an aunt in the publishing
        department, and she has supplied me with a copy. Well, it
        actually teems with circumstantially convincing details of the
        King's abominable immoralities! If this high-class journal may be
        believed, His Majesty is one of the most Heliogabalian profligates
        that ever disgraced an autocratic throne! And do these Wise Men
        denounce him to me? Not a bit of it! They wink at his
        immoralities! Under the circumstances I really think I am
        justified in exclaiming "Lalabelele molola lililah kalabalale
        poo!" (All horrified.) I don't care—the occasion demands
        it.
    
        (Exit Tarara)
    
        (March. Enter Guard, escorting Scaphio and Phantis.)
    
        CHORUS.
    
        O make way for the Wise Men!
        They are the prizemen—
        Double-first in the world's university!
        For though lovely this island
        (Which is my land),
        She has no one to match them in her city.
        They're the pride of Utopia—
        Cornucopia
        Is each his mental fertility.
        O they make no blunder,
        And no wonder,
        For they're triumphs of infallibility.
    
        DUET — Scaphio and Phantis.
    
        In every mental lore
        (The statement smacks of vanity)
        We claim to rank before
        The wisest of humanity.
        As gifts of head and heart
        We wasted on "utility,"
        We're "cast" to play a part
        Of great responsibility.
    
        Our duty is to spy
        Upon our King's illicites,
        And keep a watchful eye
        On all his eccentricities.
        If ever a trick he tries
        That savours of rascality,
        At our decree he dies
        Without the least formality.
        
        We fear no rude rebuff,
        Or newspaper publicity;
        Our word is quite enough,
        The rest is electricity.
        A pound of dynamite
        Explodes in his auriculars;
        It's not a pleasant sight—
        We'll spare you the particulars.
    
        Its force all men confess,
        The King needs no admonishing—
        We may say its success
        Is something quite astonishing.
        Our despot it imbues
        With virtues quite delectable,
        He minds his P's and Q's,—
        And keeps himself respectable.
    
        Of a tyrant polite
        He's paragon quite.
        He's as modest and mild
        In his ways as a child;
        And no one ever met
        With an autocrat yet,
        So delightfully bland
        To the least in the land!
        So make way for the wise men, etc.
    
        (Exeunt all but Scaphio and Phantis. Phantis is pensive.)
        Scaphio: Phantis, you are not in your customary exuberant
        spirits. What is wrong?
    
        Phantis: Scaphio, I think you once told me that you have never
        loved?
    
        Scaphio: Never! I have often marvelled at the fairy influence
        which weaves its rosy web about the faculties of the greatest and
        wisest of our race; but I thank Heaven I have never been subjected
        to its singular fascination. For, oh, Phantis! there is that
        within me that tells me that when my time does come, the
        convulsion will be tremendous! When I love, it will be with the
        accumulated fervor of sixty-six years! But I have an ideal—a
        semi-transparent Being, filled with an inorganic pink
        jelly—and I have never yet seen the woman who approaches
        within measurable distance of it. All are
        opaque—opaque—opaque!
    
        Phantis: Keep that ideal firmly before you, and love not until
        you find her. Though but fifty-five, I am an old campaigner in
        the battle-fields of Love; and, believe me, it is better to be as
        you are, heart-free and happy, than as I am—eternally racked
        with doubting agonies! Scaphio, the Princess Zara returns from
        England today!
    
        Scaphio: My poor boy, I see it all.
    
        Phantis: Oh! Scaphio, she is so beautiful. Ah! you smile, for
        you have never seen her. She sailed for England three months
        before you took office.
    
        Scaphio: Now tell me, is your affection requited?
    
        Phantis: I do not know—I am not sure. Sometimes I think it
        is, and then come these torturing doubts! I feel sure that she
        does not regard me with absolute indifference, for she could never
        look at me without having to go to bed with a sick headache.
    
        Scaphio: That is surely something. Come, take heart, boy! you
        are young and beautiful. What more could maiden want?
    
        Phantis: Ah! Scaphio, remember she returns from a land where
        every youth is as a young Greek god, and where such beauty as I
        can boast is seen at every turn.
    
        Scaphio: Be of good cheer! Marry her, boy, if so your fancy
        wills, and be sure that love will come.
    
        Phantis: (overjoyed) Then you will assist me in this?
    
        Scaphio: Why, surely! Silly one, what have you to fear? We have
        but to say the word, and her father must consent. Is he not our
        very slave? Come, take heart. I cannot bear to see you sad.
    
        Phantis: Now I may hope, indeed! Scaphio, you have placed me on
        the very pinnacle of human joy!
    
        DUET — Scaphio and Phantis.
    
        Scaphio: Let all your doubts take wing—
        Our influence is great.
        If Paramount our King
        Presume to hesitate
        Put on the screw,
        And caution him
        That he will rue
        Disaster grim
        That must ensue
        To life and limb,
        Should he pooh-pooh
        This harmless whim.
    
        Both: This harmless whim—this harmless whim,
        It is as I/you say, a harmless whim.
    
        Phantis: (dancing) Observe this dance
        Which I employ
        When I, by chance
        Go mad with joy.
        What sentiment
        Does this express?
    
        (Phantis continues his dance while Scaphio vainly endeavors to
        discover
        its meaning)
    
        Supreme content
        And happiness!
    
        Both: Of course it does! Of course it does!
        Supreme content and happiness.
    
        Phantis: Your friendly aid conferred,
        I need no longer pine.
        I've but to speak the word,
        And lo, the maid is mine!
        I do not choose
        To be denied.
        Or wish to lose
        A lovely bride—
        If to refuse
        The King decide,
        The royal shoes
        Then woe betide!
    
        Both: Then woe betide—then woe betide!
        The Royal shoes then woe betide!
    
        Scaphio: (Dancing) This step to use
        I condescend
        Whene'er I choose
        To serve a friend.
        What it implies
        Now try to guess;
    
        (Scaphio continues his dance while Phantis is vainly endeavouring
        to discover its meaning)
    
        It typifies
        Unselfishness!
    
        Both: (Dancing) Of course it does! Of course it does!
        It typifies unselfishness.
    
        (Exeunt Scaphio and
        Phantis.)
    
        March. Enter King Paramount, attended by guards and nobles, and
        preceded by girls dancing before him.       
    
        SONG — Lady Sophy
    
        Bold-faced ranger
        (Perfect stranger)
        Meets two well-behaved young ladies.
        He's attractive,
        Young and active—
        Each a little bit afraid is.
        Youth advances,
        At his glances
        To their danger they awaken;
        They repel him
        As they tell him
        He is very much mistaken.
        Though they speak to him politely,
        Please observe they're sneering slightly,
        Just to show he's acting vainly.
        This is Virtue saying plainly
        "Go away, young bachelor,
        We are not what you take us for!"
        When addressed impertinently,
        English ladies answer gently,
        "Go away, young bachelor,
        We are not what you take us for!"
    
        As he gazes,
        Hat he raises,
        Enters into conversation.
        Makes excuses—
        This produces
        Interesting agitation.
        He, with daring,
        Undespairing,
        Give his card—his rank discloses
        Little heeding
        This proceeding,
        They turn up their little noses.
        Pray observe this lesson vital—
        When a man of rank and title
        His position first discloses,
        Always cock your little noses.
        When at home, let all the class
        Try this in the looking glass.
        English girls of well bred notions,
        Shun all unrehearsed emotions.
        English girls of highest class
        Practice them before the glass.
    
        His intentions
        Then he mentions.
        Something definite to go on—
        Makes recitals
        Of his titles,
        Hints at settlements, and so on.
        Smiling sweetly,
        They, discreetly,
        Ask for further evidences:
        Thus invited,
        He, delighted,
        Gives the usual references:
        This is business. Each is fluttered
        When the offer's fairly uttered.
        "Which of them has his affection?"
        He declines to make selection.
        Do they quarrel for his dross?
        Not a bit of it—they toss!
        Please observe this cogent moral—
        English ladies never quarrel.
        When a doubt they come across,
        English ladies always toss.
    
        RECITATIVE — Lady Sophy
    
        The lecture's ended. In ten minute's space
        'Twill be repeated in the market-place!
    
        (Exit Lady Sophy, followed by Nekaya and
        Kalyba.)
    
        Chorus: Quaff the nectar—cull the roses—
        Bashful girls will soon be plenty!
        Maid who thus at fifteen poses
        Ought to be divine at twenty!
    
        (Exeunt all but KING.)
    
        King: I requested Scaphio and Phantis to be so good as to
        favor me with an audience this morning. (Enter SCAPHIO and
        PHANTIS.) Oh, here they are!
    
        Scaphio: Your Majesty wished to speak with us, I believe.
        You—you needn't keep your crown on, on our account, you
        know.
    
        King: I beg your pardon. (Removes it.) I always forget that!
        Odd, the notion of a King not being allowed to wear one of his own
        crowns in the presence of two of his own subjects.
    
        Phantis: Yes—bizarre, is it not?
    
        King: Most quaint. But then it's a quaint world.
    
        Phantis: Teems with quiet fun. I often think what a lucky thing
        it is that you are blessed with such a keen sense of humor!
    
        King: Do you know, I find it invaluable. Do what I will, I
        cannot help looking at the humorous side of things—for,
        properly considered, everything has its humorous side—even
        the Palace Peeper (producing it). See here—"Another Royal
        Scandal," by Junius Junior. "How long is this to last?" by Senex
        Senior. "Ribald Royalty," by Mercury Major. "Where is the Public
        Exploder?" by Mephistopheles Minor. When I reflect that all these
        outrageous attacks on my morality are written by me, at your
        command—well, it's one of the funniest things that have
        come within the scope of my experience.
    
        Scaphio: Besides, apart from that, they have a quiet humor of
        their own which is simply irresistible.
    
        King: (gratified) Not bad, I think. Biting, trenchant
        sarcasm—the rapier, not the bludgeon—that's my line.
        But then it's so easy—I'm such a good subject—a bad
        King but a good Subject—ha! ha!—a capital heading for
        next week's leading article! (makes a note) And then the
        stinging little paragraphs about our Royal goings-on with our
        Royal Second Housemaid—delicately sub-acid, are they not?
    
        Scaphio: My dear King, in that kind of thing no one can hold a
        candle to you.
    
        Phantis: But the crowning joke is the Comic Opera you've written
        for us—"King Tuppence, or A Good Deal Less than Half a
        Sovereign"—in which the celeb
