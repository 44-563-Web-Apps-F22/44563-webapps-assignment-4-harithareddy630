    <h6 class="all">ALL.</h6> So here we are, at the risk of our lives,
    From ever so far, and we've brought your wives—
    And to that end we've crossed the main,
    And don't intend to return again!
    <p>
    (Enter Zara and Fitz. They rush to the arms of Phantis and
    Scaphio.)
    </p>
    
    <div>ZARA and FITZ.</div> 

    <h6 class="Zara">Zara.</h6> <p class="speech">sailing to this island</p>
    <h6 class="King">King.</h6> <p class="speech">We are all once more on dry land</p>
    </p><h6 class="Fitz">Fitz.</h6> <p class="speech">Tossing in a manner frightful</p>
    <h6 class="King">King.</h6> <p class="speech">And we find the change delightful</p>
    <h6 class="Fitz">Fitz.</h6> <p class="speech">As at home we've been remaining
    We've not seen you both for ages,</p>
    <h6 class="Zara">Zara.</h6> <p class="speech">Tell me, are you fond of reigning?
    How's the food, and what's the wages?</p>
    <h6 class="King">King.</h6> <p class="speech">Does your new employment please ye?</p>
    <h6 class="Fitz">Fitz.</h6> <p class="speech">How does Royalizing strike you?</p>
    <h6 class="Zara">Zara.</h6> <p class="speech">Is it difficult or easy?—</p>
    <h6 class="King">King.</h6> <p class="speech">Do you think your subjects like you?</p>
    <h6 class="Fitz">Fitz.</h6> <p class="speech">I am anxious to elicit,
    Is it plain and easy steering?</p>
    <h6 class="Fitz">Fitz.</h6> <p class="speech">Take it altogether, is it  
    Better fun than gondoliering?</p>
    <h6 class="King">King.</h6> <p class="speech">We shall both go on requesting
    Till you tell us, never doubt it;
    Everything is interesting,
    Tell us, tell us all about it!</p>
    <div class="chorus"> CHORUS. They will both go on requesting, etc.</div>    
    <h6 class="Zara">Zara.</h6> <p class="speech">Ain't the livery becoming!</p>
    <h6 class="King">King.</h6> <p class="speech">es your human being inner</p> 
    <h6 class="King">King.</h6> <p class="speech">the Royal tradesmen tip you?
    Feed on everything that nice is?</p> 
    <h6 class="Fitz">Fitz.</h6> <p class="speech">they give you wine for dinner;
    Peaches, sugar-plums, and ices?</p> 
    <h6 class="Fitz">Fitz.</h6> <p class="speech">We shall both go on requesting  
    Till you tell us, never doubt it;
    Everything is interesting, 
    Tell us, tell us all about it!</p>
    <br>
    <div class="chorus"> CHORUS. They will both go on requesting, etc.</div>     
    <p class="song">Sing hey, Lackaday! etc. When she found that he was fickle,<br> Was that great oak tree, She was in a pretty pickle, As she well might be— <br>But his gallantries were mickle, For Death followed with his sickle, And her tears<br> began to trickle For her great oak tree! Sing hey, Lackaday! etc.</p>
    this. After you left we felt very dull and mopey, and the days
    crawled by, and you never wrote; so at last I said to Gianetta,
    "I can't stand this any longer; those two poor Monarchs haven't
    got any one to mend their stockings or sew on their buttons or
    patch their clothes—at least, I hope they haven't—let us all
    pack up a change and go and see how they're getting on." And she
    said, "Done," and they all said, "Done"; and we asked old Giacopo
    to lend us his boat, and he said, "Done"; and we've crossed the
    sea, and, thank goodness, that's done; and here we are,
    and—and—I've done!
